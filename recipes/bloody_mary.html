    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <p>A Bloody Mary, as stated earlier, is fairly simple to make and only requires a handful of ingredients. These include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Tomato Juice</strong>: A spicy, or non-spicy, tomato juice cocktail like V8 works best.</li>
        <li><strong>Vodka</strong>: This is the alcohol used in Bloody Marys, and stubstitutions may not produce the same taste.</li>
        <li><strong>Worcestershire Sauce</strong>: An important ingredient to add the salty and umami-rich flavor of a Bloody Mary.</li>
        <li><strong>Hot Pepper Sauce</strong>: Optional if you don't like spicy things. But great for adding that kick to your cocktail.</li>
        <li><strong>Salt and Pepper</strong>: This adds extra flavor.</li>
        <li><strong>Garnishes</strong>: A Bloody Mary usually has a number of garnishes. In this case, you can use celery and garlic-stuffed olives. However, garnishes can be substituted, added, or removed to your liking.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Simple, right? With only six ingredients it's an easy task to actually make the cocktail as well.</p>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <p>Since a Bloody Mary does not contain any carbonated beverages, all you need is a cocktail shaker.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Put all the ingredients, except garnishes, into your cocktail shaker.</li>
        <li>Shake it up.</li>
        <li>Serve in your glass of choice with the chosen garnishes.</li>
        <li>Enjoy!!</li>
    </ol>
