    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <p>I'm tired of repeating myself; cocktails are easy to make and have like five ingredients in all of them. I might stop including a paragraph after ingredients entirely. How do recipe bloggers come up with so much to say.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Ice</strong>: This recipe makes four margaritas and calls for four cups. Add however much you want.</li>
        <li><strong>Frozen Limeade Concentrate</strong>: You'll need 1 can of this stuff.</li>
        <li><strong>Tequila</strong>: This recipe calls for 6 fluid ounces of tequila.</li>
        <li><strong>Triple Sec</strong>: You'll need 2 fluid ounces of triple sec.</li>
        <li><strong>Lime</strong>: You'll need some lime wedges for garnish.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <p>Get out your blender and get mixing.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Add your ingredients minus the lime wedges into a blender.</li>
        <li>Blend.</li>
        <li>Serve in glasses with lime wedge garnishes.</li>
        <li>Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
