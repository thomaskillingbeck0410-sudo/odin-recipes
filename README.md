Project 1 for the Odin Project.
I probably should have written this before I actually wrote my code. I have very little experience in coding, so I'm stoked with how this came out. I for sure wanted to practice the target="_blank" and rel="noopener noreferrer" attributes. I also wanted to try and add some absolute links, which I got by linking to the original source. I also wanted to try out the width and height attributes for my pictures, since I'm not sure about how the scaling works yet.

I did a lot more than was asked, primarily because the code was pretty much the same for each page so I wanted to try and do it a lot so I could practice. Finally, I used the strong attribute for bolding the name of the ingredients in my ingredients list, since I wanted practice with using the attribute and I thought it looked better. Since I don't know how to use CSS, this was my next best option.
